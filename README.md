To simulate on-prem connectivity, we primarily use a Cisco 1000v from the AWS console, deploy it in a VPC and create a site-to-site VPN to a VGW attached to another VPC. This involves downloading the config and then picking out the relevant sections, modifying the tunnel source interfaces, local-address config, etcâ€¦ which is time-consuming and also error-prone. 

To avoid such issues, you could make use of the below python script which would clean up the config and replace the relevant interfaces. 

Save the python script as cleanup_config.py

Download the VPN config from AWS console or Aviatrix controller and  run the script using the below syntax:

python cleanup_config.py -f <vpn_config_file_name>

Example:

```shell
python cleanup_config.py -f vpn-0302c7988e405b648.txt
